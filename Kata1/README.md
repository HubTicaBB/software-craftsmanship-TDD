# Kata 1: Leap Years

Implement the `IsLeap()` function of the `Year` class, so that it returns `true`
or `false` depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.

**A leap year is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100, unless 
it is also divisible by 400. E.g.:**

- 1996 --> true  
- 2001 --> false  
- 2000 --> true  
- 1900 --> false
